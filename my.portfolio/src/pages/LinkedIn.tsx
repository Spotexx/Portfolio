                    <p>I am a <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>full-stack developer</span> and have a background in finance. I find manipulating data and growing my ability exciting. I am a <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>problem solver</span> and a team player. Because I have received so much assistance in my educational journey, I find myself giving back to people where possible. In addition to my almmost <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>two years</span> of personal experience, I have recently earned a certificate in full-stack web development from the University of Toronto. I love learning new languages and seeing code in different ways. I enjoy working on software that I can practically use in my life. I am a front-end developer. I use HTML, CSS, JS, and can build apps with Metaâ€™s React framework.</p>
